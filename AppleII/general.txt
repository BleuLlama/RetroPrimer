Apple IIc usage primer

1. Make an ADTPro cable, and get the ADTPro software
	https://adtpro.com

2. Run the ADTPro bootstrap to get the ADTPro disk image to a physical disk.
 - Makes it possible to get going on an Apple II with only some blank(able) floppies

3. Snag ProDOS disk and use ADTPro to copy it to a floppy
	https://prodos8.com/

From here, we have all we need to get started on the system, but
some additional

stuff make life more worth living:


Editing BASIC programs on the II with the builtin editor functions
(ESC/I/J/K/L) will make you want to run screaming.  TSR-like utilities
such as Beagle Brothers "Program Writer" are basically necessary
to keep you sane.

Other options suggested from KansasFest folks include:

	"G.A.P.E." http://www.huibert-aalbers.com/EarlyDays/AppleII/GAPE/index.html
		Global Applesoft Program Editor
		https://github.com/huibert7/G.A.P.E.-Global-Applesoft-Program-Editor-/releases/tag/1.0

and 
	"PLE" ?


Apple II info primer

	- ADTPro - serial based tool that lets you transfer disk image 
		files from a modern desktop computer (PC/Mac/Linux) to actual 
		disks on your Apple II (and vice versa)

	- DOS vs ProDOS
		- "DOS" v3.3 is the older version of the disk interface system.  it's 
			probably good enough for modern usage with just plain floppies, but
			there's really no reason not to go with ProDOS.

			BRUN PROGRAMNAME			run a program from a disk
			CAT							list disk contents
			RUN PROGRAM,D2				load and run a program from disk 2

			Files are basically accessed by the last disk accessed. so 
			saving a program after the above "RUN" will save it to disk 2.


		- "ProDOS 8" v2.4.2 Is the most recent version. Originally released 

			by Apple, it's now maintained by a guy that used to work 
			on it at apple.  Even though the most modern version is 
			not provided from apple, it's the one you want.

			ProDOS adds subfolders, but shortens filenames to 15 characters 
			long, adds support for larger disks (3.5" unidrive, etc), 
			and other general quality of life improvements

			- PROGRAMNAME				run a program from a disk
			CAT							list disk contents
			CATALOG						list disk contents

			- working with subfolders is cumbersome, but okay.  Tools on the 
			ProDOS disk are pretty much required for moving, well, 
			copying files around.  Apparently you use the full 
			qualifier for the directory, 
			like:  "S6,D2:/DISKNAME/DIRECTORY" for slot 6, disk 2, disk named "DISKNAME"
			etc.

		Unknowns yet:
			- move a file into a subdirectory
			- loading basic files from subdirectory

		In base DOS or ProDOS, the disks of the "other DOS" are not readable
		however they can be copied over using a tool like "Copy II Plus",
		which is on the ProDOS distribution disk.

	- ProDOS Primer
		- on startup it will run the first .SYSTEM file it finds.
		- Files on the disk (in the order they're on the disk)

			VIEW.README				loads the readie file (like "more")
			BITSY.BOOT				pick a new slot to boot from
			QUIT.SYSTEM				bitsy.bye - nice app/file launcher
			BASIC.SYSTEM			Applesoft BASIC
			COPYIIPLUS.8.4			Copy II Plus - copy/create directories, disks, etc
			CAT.DOCTOR				Catalog (directory) manipulations/reorder, etc
			ADTPRO2.0.2				ADTPro, slightly older version
			FASTDSK.SYSTEM			lets some other apps interact with the disk faster
			UNSHRINK				unshrinks (decompresses) crunched files
			BLOCKWARDEN				disk sector editor
			MR.FIXIT.Y2K			disk repair utility
			MAKE.SMALL.P8			makes a smaller version of ProDOS, removing IIGS stuff
			MINIBAS					Smaller Applesoft BASIC interpreter, not editor.
			ADTPRO2.0.2.BIN			Support content for ADTPro
			CD.EXT					CD Rom support ?
			FASTDSK					binary for helping faster disk operations ?
			FASTDSK.CONF			configuration for that ?
			README					textfile: readme
			PRODOS					core ProDOS system

		I made a "edit basic programs" version of the ProDOS disk, by starting with
		a copy of the ProDOS disk, and stripping it down to these files:

			BITSY.BOOT				(not sure if needed)
			QUIT.SYSTEM				BITSY BYE for booting
			BASIC.SYSTEM			Applesoft BASIC
			COPYIIPLUS.8.4			copy files around
			MINIBAS					to try it out
			PRODOS					ProDOS

		Then I copied over from the Beagle Bros "Program Writer" disk:
			EDITOR					Program Writer TSR-like tool


		To do BASIC stuff, I use BITSY to pick the BASIC program on the disk, to
		load it, or I pick BASIC.SYSTEM to just start with a fresh slate.

		From there, I type:
			- editor

		to load in Program Writer, which can be called up while in BASIC by 
		typing:
			&&

		Saving files is as easy as:
			SAVE filename

		It works really well



	- BASIC
		There are essentially two versions of BASIC available.
		First is the older "Integer BASIC" and the better
		"Floating Point BASIC" which is also commonly known
		as "Applesoft BASIC".

		Switching into Integer basic can be done by typing
		"INT", and to Floating Point basic by typing "FP".
		Either of these will erase your program in memory,
		even if it's going to the same version.

		Most all examples I've found are for FP/Applesoft BASIC.

		On the ProDOS disk, the file "BASIC.SYSTEM" contains Applesoft BASIC.

		When running a program, pressing CONTROL-C will
		break it.  If you have input/output redirected to
		a slot (PR#/IN#) then CONTROL-RESET will reset
		input/output to the keyboard/screen


	- Disk replacements
		On Apple II machines with slots, "BOOTI" or
		"MicroDrive/Turbo" or "PiDrive" are drive/disk
		emulators, if you don't want to use physical floppies,
		or for if you want to have larger disks or hard
		disks.


	- Apple IIc has a "terminal mode" which i haven't gotten
		to work at 4800 baud.


		Page 314 here: https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/Apple%20II%20Documentation%20Project/Books/Gary%20B.%20Little%20-%20Inside%20the%20Apple%20IIc.pdf
		(pg 333 of the PDF)

		IN#2 [return] [control-a] T					(doesn't echo input) 
		IN#2 [return] PR#2 [return]	[control-a] T	(echoes input)

		or for 4800 baud:
		IN#2 [return] [control-i] 12B PR#2 [return]	 [control-a] T


		program to set baud rate

		6551 control register
		[7]		0x00 - 1 stop bit
				0x80 - 2/1 stop bit
		[6,5]	0x00 - 8 bits
				0x20 - 7 bits
				0x40 - 6 bits
				0x60 - 5 bits
		[4]		0x00 - external rx clock
				0x10 - baud rate generator

		[3..0]	baud rate
				0x06	300 baud (default?)
				0x07	600 baud
				0x08	1200 baud
				0x0c	4800 baud
				0x0E 	9600 baud
				0x0F	19200 baud

		4800 baud 8N1 = 0x1c (28d)

		eg: "24" = 0x18 -> baud rate gen, 8N1 1200 baud

	Font / graphics rom 
	* IIgs, IIenhanced, IIc
		- need to be in 80 column mode
		- MouseText https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MouseText
		eg:

			PR#3
			INVERSE : PRINT CHR$(27);"XY";CHR$(24); : NORMAL



Disk image (DSK) file retrieval:

	the goal is to copy files off of a DSK image on a desktop computer to
	the desktop computer's filesystem... namely BASIC Programs.

	Suggested tools:
		- Ciderpress
		- AppleCommander
		- VirtualBasic (https://virtualbasic.org/) to covert text files without line numbers to AppleSoft.

	Process that worked:
		- use the Virtual ][ emulator, boot up an emulated //c with the .DSK image loaded in
		- Set the virtual printer to output to a text file.

		- Brendan B's version

			- PR#3:PR#1:LIST 

		- kaldor's version: (adds to basic program)

			0 poke 33,33:d$=chr$(4):f$=“myprog.txt”:?d$”OPEN”f$:?d$”WRITE”f$:LIST 1-:?d$”CLOSE”f$:TEXT:END
			Edit with text editor
			EXEC myprog.txt

		- working version: (TEST THIS)

			- 40 col mode: without indenting (the poke)
				PR#1:POKE 33,33
			- wide view, w/line breaks at 80 cols:
				PR#3:PR#1
			- w/out line breaks: without idnenting (the poke for 80 cols)
				POKE 33,73

//c ROM stuff:
	https://www.bigmessowires.com/2015/05/29/apple-iic-rom-upgrade/
	in short:
	in BASIC type: 
		PRINT PEEK( 64447 )

	255: 	16k ROM: Original //c ROM. My system had this.  no diagnostics, boot from drive II via PR#7
	0:		32k ROM: Added Unidisk/Smartport Disks (needs jumpers cut, etc)
	3: 		newer IIc boards with RAM expansion
	4:		v3 with bugfixes
	4x:		hacked version with additional diagnositcs and tools.


	- I have an early //c without RAM expansion header.  I'm
		running ROM4x, which is probably overkill, as my
		Mouse is now moved to slot 7. I should probably
		downgrade to ROM 0.

	RESET/BREAK Notes:
		CTRL-C
			warm-break in the current BASIC program,
			but will not redirect in/out (PR/IN)

		CTRL-RESET
			acts like CTRL-C but also resets in/out

		CTRL-OpenApple-RESET
			old/Hard reset (like power-on)
			- release CTRL, RESET first
			- relase OpenApple last

		CTRL-ClosedApple-RESET
			Cold/Hard reset for 4x rom. goes to 4x menu
			- release CTRL, RESET first
			- release ClosedApple last

		CTRL-OpenApple-ClosedApple-RESET
			Cold/Hard reset, goes to rom Diagnostics on 0,3,4 ROMs
			- release CTRL, RESET first
			- release OpenApple, ClosedApple last
